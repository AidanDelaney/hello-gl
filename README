This is the source code for the "hello world" OpenGL application described in
chapter 2 of Joe Groff's OpenGL tutorial: <<not published yet>>

You will need the GLUT <http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/> and
GLEW <http://glew.sourceforge.net/> libraries to compile this program. It also
requires OpenGL 2.0 or later.
